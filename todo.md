# Create a backend

## Begin by create  add operation

1. Create model of employee with appropriates annotation
2. Create a repository (extends a JpaRepository )
3. Create a service inject a jpa repository
4. Create a controller to expose API
5. Test API using postMen (create some employees)

Questions (that I haven't answer now):

- Why using a default constructor in Employee Class
- Why use transactional annotation in a Service
